        <p class="subTitleEvent">Tulips in Holland</p>
        <p class="eventContent">Tulips from Holland are world famous. If you want to see the Dutch tulip fields in bloom, you should visit Holland in April and May. This is the same period in which the biggest flower park in the world, Keukenhof, opens its doors.

Gardens and four pavilions show a fantastic collection of: tulips, hyacinths, daffodils, orchids, roses, carnations, irises, lilies and many other flowers. You will be overwhelmed by a spectacle of colors and perfumes.</p>
        <p class="subTitleEvent">Holland and Flowers</p>
        <p class="eventContent">Keukenhof is unique in the world and an unforgettable experiences for people of all ages. Unfortunately, the park is only open 8 weeks a year. You can reach Keukenhof within half an hour from The Hague, Haarlem, Leiden, Delft and Amsterdam. However, traffic is problematic around Keukenhof during the opening weeks. A great alternative is to stay in Zandvoort, Noordwijk or Leiden and reach Keukenhof by bike. You will cycle along the tulip fields and enjoy the unique Dutch landscape.
Two more tips! If you want to have a really flowery day out, you should combine a visit to the Keukenhof with the Flower Parade in April. Save time and money and order your tickets ahead online.</p>
