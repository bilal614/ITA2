<p>Holland, with its long North Sea coast, has a typically moderate marine climate. The sea’s influence ensures that we are not too cold during winter, not too hot during summer, and there is always sufficient moisture in the air for a shower. So if you plan to visit Holland, it would be wise to keep this in mind. Put the right clothing in your suitcase so you are covered if there’s an afternoon rainfall and make sure you always have a critical opinion about the weather... Just like the Dutch do! </br></p>
<p>Holland has a moderate marine climate and, as such, enjoys fairly mild winters and not-too-hot summers. A secondary effect of the coastal climate is the fact that rain may fall throughout the year. There is no real rainy season and certainly no long dry periods. As a result, many Dutch residents feel that they live in a rainy country. Fortunately, this isn’t true.</br>
Actually it does not rain all that much... but the idea that it may rain at any time gives you that feeling. The unpredictability is caused by the country’s location by the sea, its lack of mountains and the fact that we are on the divide between hot and cold weather. Depressions may blow in from the sea and are not stopped by mountain ranges.</br></p>
<p>All in all, Holland has about 700 millimetres of rainfall each year. This is not a huge amount of water. The unpredictability of the weather in all seasons is a more notable feature of the Dutch climate. A hot, sunny month of June may be followed by a wet, grey July. In January we may experience a ten degree frost or rather ten degrees above zero. It isn’t surprising that the Dutch always have something to say about the weather.</p>
